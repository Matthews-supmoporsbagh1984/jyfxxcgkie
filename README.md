Holy shit. Just stumbled out of You're Cordially Invited and my brain's still doing cartwheels. Like, I don't even... Where do I start?? It’s like my head's a mess of popcorn and left field scenes. Kept shifting in my seat, loud crunch, sorry to the dude next to me, but the whole theater, buzzing like a hornet's nest.

> Can’t even BREATHE — the opening scene was like, BANG, instant hit of adrenaline. One minute I'm shuffling to find my seat, and the next, I’m thrust into this twisted wedding circus. You know how it feels to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a swan take flight and crash-land in spaghetti?? Yeah, like THAT, but with vows and chaos. There was this one part with a cat...like it made no sense but somehow all the sense — surreal, but nailed it.

The main guy - with the tie and that weird, desperate grin like a frog trying to be a prince. If I ever design a tattoo that confusing, I’ll have to tattoo my own face in shame. Remember that bar scene? Pure gold. It was like dunking your head in an aquarium but with gin bubbles and regret. A cacophony, that's the word, right? See the bride's dress morphing, like shadows in my studio when the light flickers out. Man, surreal visuals--like dreaming but you’re the dreamer and imagined all wrong. Mood swings harder than my old tattoo gun. 

> I swear, at one point, I thought I saw something outta turn, like, is he really gonna...?? Then it went and happened, a twist as satisfying as a butter-smooth line of ink cutting through flesh. It got wild, wackier than a monkey high on espresso. You gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to pause at that ONE frame—trust.

And the music! Did I mention the music? A hurricane of notes crashing down, loud enough to feel the tempo in my bones, almost like it's tattooing my soul...haha. Yeah, scratch that. Maybe I just need a chiropractor—back’s killing me. Couldn’t escape the feeling, like an itch. The storm that just won't pass, like, hey, you wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   one more time, see what I missed?

All in all, I'd say...um, fish and lemons. Yeah, might not mean much now but in the moment??? Totally connected. God, I think someone spilled Coke on the seat, sticking to my jeans. Gonna miss this madness once reality checks back in or my phone dies, whichever's first.

```csharp
void EndReview()
{
	Console.WriteLine(What even was that?);
	Tangles and mystery adorn();
	EnjoyRandomness(true);
	Random();
}
```

There. Totally just a bystander in my own head now.
